opencv_abi_check
================

This repository contains a few simple scripts for checking the ABI compatibility of the OpenCV4Tegra library against the default version of OpenCV

Notes
=====

This repository makes a few assumptions about the packages in question:

 * The OCL library is not included in the comparison, because OpenCV4Tegra does not include it
